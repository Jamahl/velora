üìù Notes for Engineering LLM

Test each task thoroughly before moving to the next
Keep tasks small and focused - if a task feels too large, break it down
Maintain consistency with the PRD architecture
Document any deviations from the plan
Prioritize functionality over perfection for MVP
Test integration points carefully between tasks
Use proper error handling from the start
Follow security best practices throughout
